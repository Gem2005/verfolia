## Console Logs to Monitor

### Upload Phase:

[AI Parse] Parsing: resume.pdf (90730 bytes)
[AI Parse] Successfully parsed with AI in 3500ms
```

### Prefill Phase:
```
[Prefill] Loaded resume data: {
  title: "Resume from resume.pdf",
  hasPersonalInfo: true,

  educationCount: 3,
  skillsCount: 27,

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Resume data not found"
**Cause:** SessionStorage expired or cleared
**Solution:** Re-upload the resume

### Issue: "Failed to parse resume"
**Cause:** API key missing or invalid
**Solution:** Check `.env.local` has valid `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Issue: Custom sections not showing
**Cause:** Resume doesn't have custom sections OR they're not being detected
**Solution:** Check console for `customSectionsCount`, verify resume has Achievements/Leadership sections

### Issue: Education shows "null"
**Cause:** Old code (should be fixed)
**Solution:** Check that prompt update is deployed

### Issue: Internships in both experience and custom sections
**Cause:** Duplication logic not working
**Solution:** Check AI parser prompt has anti-duplication instructions
